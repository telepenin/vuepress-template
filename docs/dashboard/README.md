* _IP_ - the IP address of the abuser.
There is a color indication for IP address.
  * A gray bubble means that this IP address is currently in the <span class="notranslate">Gray List</span> (so, every connection from this IP address will redirect to the CAPTCHA).
  * A blue bubble means that this IP address is currently in no one list (<span class="notranslate">White/Gray/Black</span>). IP is not blocked.
  * A white bubble means that this IP address is currently in the <span class="notranslate">White List</span>. IP will never be blocked by Imunify360.
  * A black bubble means that this IP address is currently in the <span class="notranslate">Black List</span>. And access from this IP is totally blocked without ability to unblock by the CAPTCHA.
  * No bubble is shown when this incident doesn’t contain IP address.
* <span class="notranslate">_Country_ </span>– country origin of the abuser IP address.
* <span class="notranslate">_Count_</span> – the number of times the abuser tried to repeat the action.
* <span class="notranslate">_Event_</span> – description of the event or suspicious activity (as it is described by OSSEC and Mod_Security sensors).
* <span class="notranslate">_Severity_</span> – severity level of the incidents (as it is estimated in [OSSEC severity levels](https://ossec-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/manual/rules-decoders/rule-levels.html?highlight=severity%20level) and [Mod_Security severity levels](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#severity)). The color of severity means:

  * Green – Mod_Security levels 7-5, OSSEC levels 00-03

![](/images/IncidentsBulkActions.png)


## Firewall


Tne <span class="notranslate">_All Lists_</span> tab allows viewing and managing the IP addresses in the following lists (listed by priority):

* <span class="notranslate">White</span> - the IP will not be blocked
* <span class="notranslate">Drop/Black</span> - the IP will be blocked everywhere, on all ports and services
* <span class="notranslate">Captcha</span> - the IP will be blocked completely on non-web ports (SSH, FTP, etc.), and will be shown CAPTCHA on web ports (80, 443, hosting panel ports)
* <span class="notranslate">SplashScreen</span> - the IP will be shown SplashScreen challenge on web ports, and will not be blocked on others

The counters for the lists are presented at the top of the table, reflecting the number of records matching the category.

![](/images/Firewall.png)

All the lists are available for search by the IP address as well as by the _Country_ and _Comment_ fields.

The IP address can be in several lists at the same time, and the highest in priority list decides how the IP will be treated.

Here, you can add or edit a comment to an IP, delete IP permanently or move it to the White/Black list. For an IP with full access you can also remove it here.

The <span class="notranslate">_Ports_</span> tab allows to manage the list of blocked ports.


#### How to add IP manually

To add an IP, click <span class="notranslate">_Add_</span> on the right side of the page. The following pop-up opens.

![](/images/addip.png)

In the pop-up choose <span class="notranslate">_IP_</span> tab and fill out:

* <span class="notranslate">_Enter IP_</span> – IP or subnet in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
* <span class="notranslate">_Enter a comment_</span> – type a comment to the IP or subnet (optional)
* <span class="notranslate">_Enter TTL_</span> in days or hours – time to live – for how long the IP will be in the White List.

### Scan

</div>

It is possible to scan a specific directory for malware. Go to <span class="notranslate">_Malware Scanner_</span> page and choose <span class="notranslate">_Scan_</span> tab. Then proceed the following steps:

1. Enter a folder name you need to scan in the <span class="notranslate">_Folder to scan_</span> field. Start typing with the slash `/`.

    It is possible to use Advanced Settings:

   * <span class="notranslate">_Filename mask_</span>. It allows to set file type for scanning (for example, `*.php` – all the files with extension php). Default setting is `*` which means all files without restriction.
   * <span class="notranslate">_Ignore mask_</span>. It allows to set file type to ignore (for example, `*.html` – will ignore all file with extension html).
   * <span class="notranslate">_CPU consumption_</span>. Defines the CPU consumption for scanning without decreasing efficiency:
	     * from <span class="notranslate">Low</span> to <span class="notranslate">High</span>.
   * <span class="notranslate">_I/O consumption_</span>. Defines the I/O consumption for scanning without decreasing efficiency:
	     * from <span class="notranslate">Low</span> to <span class="notranslate">High</span>.
	* <span class="notranslate">_Follow symlinks_</span>. Follow all symlinks within the folder to scan. 

:::tip Note
If Imunify360 is running on CloudLinux OS, LVE is used to manage scan intensity. If it is running on other operating systems, “nice” is used to control CPU and “ionice” is used when the I/O scheduler is CFQ.

## Proactive Defense


### Overview

 
<span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is a unique Imunify360 feature that can prevent malicious activity through PHP scripts. It is available as a PHP module for Apache and LiteSpeed web servers and analyzes script activity using known patterns like obfuscated command injection, malicious code planting, sending spam, SQL injection etc.

:::tip Note
Proactive Defense requires [Hardened PHP](/dashboard/#installation) (alt-php) to operate.
:::

### User Interface

Go to <span class="notranslate">Imunify360 → Proactive Defense</span>.

![](/images/proactivedefensemain_zoom70.png)

Here you can set a mode, view detected events and perform actions on them.

![](/images/proactivedefensegeneralui_zoom70.png)

#### Mode Settings

The following <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> modes are available:
* <span class="notranslate">Disabled</span> — means that <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> feature is not working and a system is not protected enough
* <span class="notranslate">Log Only</span> — means that possible malicious activity is only logged, no actions are performed (default mode)
* <span class="notranslate">Kill Mode</span> — the highest level of protection — the script is terminated as soon as malicious activity is detected

To select a mode, tick the desired checkbox. When an action is completed, you will see a pop-up with the successful mode changing message.
![](/images/proactivedefensemodesettings_zoom70.png)

::: tip Note

#### How to test Proactive Defense

1. Set <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> to <span class="notranslate">_Log only_</span> mode (requests will not be blocked) or to <span class="notranslate">_Kill mode_</span> to kill all requests.
2. Add the following row in order to enable test mode rules:

<div class="notranslate">
	
```	
echo 'check_mode = -10' >> /usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini
```
</div>

3. Create a file with the following content:

<div class="notranslate">

``` PHP
<?php
$pattern = 'TEST-FILE';
$external_code = @file_get_contents('https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt');
if (strpos($external_code,$pattern)){
    print "Poactive Defence DOESN'T work or NOT in KILL mode";
}
else {
    print "Proactive Defence works fine - file_get_contents function has been BLOCKED, please check Imunify360 Proactive Defence tab for corresponding BLOCK event";
}
?>
```
</div>

:::tip Note
This script is available starting from Imunify360 v. 4.10.2  
This script will only check for PD if file_get_contents is not disabled and allow_url_fopen is enabled in the PHP settings on the server.
:::

4. Place this file on the server.
5. Call a test page with the script from the point 2.
6. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is disabled, you will see "PD doesn't work or not in KILL mode" message after calling the script and no records will appear in "Incident" tab.
7. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is enabled and <span class="notranslate">_Log only_</span> mode is set, you will see "PD doesn't work or not in KILL mode" message after calling the script and a new event with description "Blamer detection" in the <span class="notranslate">_Detected Events_</span> table with "LOG" action.
8. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is enabled and <span class="notranslate">_Kill mode_</span> is set, the test page returns an error.And a new event with description "Blamer detection" in the <span class="notranslate">_Detected Events_</span> table with "KILL" action.
9. Remove the following row from the <span class="notranslate">`/usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini`</span> in order to disable test mode rules

<div class="notranslate">
	
```
check_mode = -10
```

## Reputation Management

Choose <span class="notranslate">_Reputation Management_</span> in the main menu of the Imunify360 admin interface to get to the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> page.

<span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> allows to check if a domain registered on your server is safe or not based on the following reputation engines:

* [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)
* [Yandex Safe Browsing](https://tech.yandex.com/safebrowsing/)
* [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/)
* [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/)
* [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com/).

How does it work:

* We get a list of domains periodically (via crontab)
* Send it to the central Imunify360 server
* Get results from it
* Add bad domains to the list of <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span>

If a domain or an IP is blocked, then this information will be available in the table below. If a user’s website appears in this table, then it would be useful to send [this link](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/hacked/) to the user. This instruction can help to solve problems with the domain.

At the top of the page (also in the main menu near <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> item), Imunify360 shows the number of affected domains. This number is a quantity of affected domains that exist on the server.

The table shows:

* <span class="notranslate">_ID_</span> – domain owner username
* _URL_ – the affected domain link
* <span class="notranslate">_Type_</span> – read more about types [on the link](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/reference/rest/v4/ThreatType) (we still do not support <span class="notranslate">THREAT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED</span> and <span class="notranslate">POTENTIALLY_HARMFUL_APPLICATION</span>).
* <span class="notranslate">_Detection time_</span> – exact time when the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> has detected the domain

![](/images/reputation_zoom73.png) 

Click link icon in the <span class="notranslate">_Action_</span> column to copy the URL to the clipboard.

::: tip Note
<span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> online and browser look may differ. This is because Google Safe Browsing has an issue described on github.

This feature is deprecated.
:::

The KernelCare extension for Imunify360 allows tracing malicious invocations to detect privilege escalation attempts.

You can find these attempts on the [Incidents tab](/dashboard/#incidents) (as part of the OSSEC log). The incidents can be seen by filtering events with the `EDF` label. 

To enable the feature, tick the <span class="notranslate">_Privilege escalation detection & protection_</span> checkbox.

![](/images/pep_kernelcare.png)

:::warning Note
The _Privilege escalation detection & protection_ feature is implemented for CentOS 7 only.
:::

Or you can enable it via CLI using the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"KERNELCARE": {"edf": true}}'
```
</div>


Click <span class="notranslate">_Save changes_</span> button on the bottom of the section to save changes.

#### WAF Settings

When the <span class="notranslate">_Minimized ModSec Ruleset_</span> option is on, it disables Imunify WAF rules with a high memory footprint, yet leaves critical ruleset enabled. It is recommended for the servers with a small amount of RAM. It is enabled by default for the installations with low RAM.

You can switch back to the normal mode by enabling WebShield or unchecking <span class="notranslate">_Minimized ModSec Ruleset_</span> in Settings | General | WAF Settings

#### WordPress account brute-force protection

Server admin can enable an option to prevent access to WordPress accounts with well-known (trivial) passwords.
When the option is enabled, all end-users that are trying to log into the admin account with weak/trivial or well-known passwords from the dictionary used by brute-forcers will be taken to the special alert page with an appeal to change their current password.

This feature can be enabled by setting <span class="notranslate">`cms_account_compromise_prevention` to `true`</span> in MOD_SEC [config file section](/config_file_description/#config-file-description)

:::tip Note
This feature is implemented via modsec rule and could be partially [disabled on a per-domain basis](/command_line_interface/#rules) (the rule id is 33355)
:::

![](/images/waf_wordpress_acp_alert.png)

The alert page supports localization and is displayed in the language of the browser (on an external Imunify domain).

#### CMS-specific WAF Rules

WAF Rules Auto-Configurator generates a set of rules on a per-domain basis, considering the Content Management System (CMS), that the website is running (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal etc).

It allows making WAF rules more effective to protect websites and reduce the number os false positives.

It works in the background and scans domains for installed CMS daily, after that rebuilds ModSec configuration based on detected software.

![](/images/cms-specific_waf_rules.png)

:::tip Note
This feature is only available for the Apache 2.4 web server
:::

#### DoS Protection

<span class="notranslate">DoS Protection</span> section allows to enable or disable DoS protection. DoS protection works by counting connections from each remote IP address per local port separately.
To enable/disable it, tick the <span class="notranslate">_Enable Dos Protection_</span> checkbox. Or you can enable it using the following CLI command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"DOS": {"enabled": true}}'
```
</div>

It is possible to configure how Imunify360 will behave:

* <span class="notranslate">_Max Connections_</span>– allows to setup the number of simultaneous connections allowed before IP will be blocked. Cannot be set lower than 100.
* <span class="notranslate">_Check delay_</span> – allows to setup period in seconds between each DoS detection system activation that will check a server for DoS attack. Also, it is possible to set different limits for different local ports by editing the [configuration file](/config_file_description/) directly.

**The minimum values**: 

* Max Connections = 100
* Check delay = 30

:::tip Note
_Check delay_ is limited by the minimum value of 30, lower values can cause "false positives" triggering.
:::

:::tip Note
Although DoS protection works on the TCP level, it is not the same as http request rate - even if there is large number of http connections, the number of TCP connections can be relatively low.
:::

:::tip Note
Imunify360 DoS protection is automatically disabled if CSF is active - a warning is shown in Imunify360 UI in that case

#### SMTP Traffic Manager

SMTP traffic management provides more control over SMTP traffic.

An administrator can redirect mail traffic to the local MTA, block it completely, or keep it available for local mails only. Administrators can also block particular ports and whitelist specific users or groups for outgoing mail.

This feature extends the existing cPanel <span class="notranslate">“Block SMTP”</span> functionality, albeit with more control and capabilities, and replaces the similar functionality from CSF. 

You can enable the <span class="notranslate">SMTP Traffic Management</span> in the <span class="notranslate">Settings</span>:

![](/images/SMTPSettings.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**SMTP ports**</span> - a list of the ports to be blocked. The defaults are: 25, 587,465
* <span class="notranslate">**Allow users**</span> a list of the users to be ignored (not blocked). By default it is empty. Including Unix and CPanel users (if a process that sends an email has a UID of one of the <span class="notranslate">`allow_users`</span>, it will not be blocked)
* <span class="notranslate">**Allow groups**</span> - a list of the groups to be ignored (not blocked). By default it is empty. Including Unix and CPanel users (if a process that sends an email has a UID of one of the <span class="notranslate">`allow_users`</span>, it will not be blocked)
* <span class="notranslate">**Allow local**</span> - block all except the local SMTP (localhost). By default it is disabled.
* <span class="notranslate">**Redirect to local**</span> - enable automatic redirection to the local ports for outgoing mail traffic. By default it is disabled.

::: tip Note
The following is added by default into the _Allow users_ and the _Allow groups_ for cPanel:
* UIDs - 0 (root), 202 (cpanel)
* GIDs - 12 (mail) 
:::

To enable these settings via direct config file update or a command-line interface, use this command: 

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"SMTP_BLOCKING": {"allow_local": true, "enable": true}}'
```
</div>

The config file should show:

<div class="notranslate">

```
SMTP_BLOCKING:
 allow_groups:
 - mailacc
 allow_local: true
 allow_users: []
 enable: true
 ports:
 - 25
 - 587
 - 465
 redirect: true
```
</div>

#### What if the Conflict with WHM >> SMTP Restrictions message is shown?

![](/images/SMTPFAQ.png)

::: tip Note
Read [CXS integration](/ids_integration/#cxs-integration) documentation carefully to make Malware Scanner work properly if you decided to use the former instead of Imunify360 anti-malware protection.
:::


#### Resource consumption

![](/images/SettingsMalwareResourceConsumption.png)

* <span class="notranslate">_CPU consumption_</span> – allows to set a level of CPU usage by Malware Scanner.
    ::: tip Note
    Low CPU usage means low scanning speed
    :::
* <span class="notranslate">_I/O consumption_</span> – allows to set a level of I/O usage by Malware Scanner.
    :::tip Note
    Low I/O usage means low scanning speed
    :::

    :::tip Note
    If Imunify360 is running on CloudLinux OS, LVE is used to manage scan intensity. If it is running on other operating systems, “nice” is used to control CPU and “ionice” is used when the I/O scheduler is CFQ.
    :::

#### General

![](/images/SettingsMalware2.png)

* <span class="notranslate">_Automatically scan all modified files_</span> – enables real-time scanning for modified files using [inotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify) library. The Scanner searches for modified files in user’s DocumentRoot directories.
  ::: tip Note
  It requires inotify to be installed and may put an additional load on a system.
  :::
* <span class="notranslate">_Optimize real-time scan_</span> – enables the [File Change API](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_kernel/#file-change-api) and **fanotify** support to reduce the system load while watching for file changes in comparison with inotify watchs.
    :::tip Note
    File change API can work only with ext4 file system.

  * <span class="notranslate">Cleanup</span> (default)

  :::warning Warning
  Starting from ImunifyAV(+) v.6.2, the _Quarantine_ and _Delete_ actions were removed permanently from the UI as well as the CLI in ImunifyAV(+). Previously quarantined files are also subject to deletion. After this change is implemented, the restoration of the previously quarantined files will become impossible. For more information see this [this blog post](https://blog.imunify360.com/file-quarantine-is-no-longer-effective).
  :::


:::tip Note
Those options may be hidden for end-user if Cleanup is disabled in Features Management.
:::

* <span class="notranslate">_Enable RapidScan_</span> – dramatically speeds up repeated scans based on smart re-scan approach, local result caching and cloud-assisted scan. When you first enable the RapidScan feature, the first scan will run as before. But subsequent scans will see a dramatic speed improvement, anywhere between 5 to 20 times faster. You can find details [here](/features/#rapidscan).
* <span class="notranslate">_Binary (ELF) malware detection_</span> – this option allows to search for any binaries (ELF files) in the user home directories and consider them malicious.
* <span class="notranslate">_Enable Hyperscan_</span> – this option allows to use the regex matching Hyperscan library in Malware Scanner to greatly improve the scanning speed. Hyperscan requires its own signatures set that will be downloaded from the files.imunify360.com and compiled locally. 
There are few platform requirements to use this feature:
  * Hyperscan supports Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS/CloudLinux 7 and later.
  * SSE3 processor instructions support. It is quite common nowadays, but may be lacking in virtual environments or in some rather old servers.

#### Crontab files Scanning

This is the mechanism allowing to address Crontab infections with our powerful Malware scanner. Enabled, it will catch any event of Crontab file modification on the fly in seconds and keep them malware-free in real-time.

<img src="/images/crontabScanning.png" border="1px solid grey"/>

The cleanup results are available on the *Malware* and *History* tabs of the Imunify360 interface as for any other type of malware.

Tick required checkboxes and click <span class="notranslate">_Save changes_</span> button.

#### Background Scanning

Allows to set up automatic, scheduled, background scanning of user accounts.

* <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> — select the desired period:
  * <span class="notranslate">Never</span>
  * <span class="notranslate">Daily</span>
  * <span class="notranslate">Weekly</span>
  * <span class="notranslate">Monthly</span>

![](/images/background_scanning1.png)

Depending on the selected period, precise settings.

* If <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> is set to <span class="notranslate">_Daily_</span>, choose the exact time at the <span class="notranslate">_Run at_</span> dropdown.

* If <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> is set to <span class="notranslate">_Weekly_</span>, choose the day of the week at the <span class="notranslate">_Run on_</span> dropdown and exact time at the <span class="notranslate">_Run at_</span> dropdown.

* If <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> is set to <span class="notranslate">_Monthly_</span>, choose the day of the month at the <span class="notranslate">_Day of month to run_</span> dropdown and exact time at the <span class="notranslate">_Run at_</span> dropdown.

You can track the scanning activity at the <span class="notranslate">[Malware Scanner](#malware-scanner)</span> tab.


#### Cleanup

* <span class="notranslate">_Trim file instead of removal_</span> — do not remove infected file during cleanup but make the file zero-size (for malwares like web-shells);
* <span class="notranslate">_Keep original files for … days_</span> — the original infected file is available for restore within the defined period. Default is 14 days.

![](/images/malwarescannersettings_zoom70.png)


#### Proactive Defense

* <span class="notranslate">_Enable Blamer_</span> — tick to allow Imunify360 to find a root cause of how infection got injected into the server through PHP. Blamer pinpoints exact URL, PHP script & PHP execution path that allowed a hacker to inject malware onto the server.
Imunify360 security team will use that information to prevent future infections from happening.

![](/images/SettingsBlamer.png)

To reduce the number of blamer events, similar events are combined by default into a single one. In order to disable it, specify the <span class="notranslate">`filter_messages=off`</span> in the <span class="notranslate">_/usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini_</span>

* <span class="notranslate">_PHP Immunity_</span> — tick to allow Imunify360 automatically detect and patch vulnerabilities in software at the Proactive Defense level preventing re-infections through the same vulnerability.

Once a vulnerable script or unknown malware executes any malicious flow which in turn leads to a malware drop, it causes the auto-generate rule to be released for the Proactive Defence. Ultimately, it will stop any further attempts to exploit the vulnerability or drop malware. Any dropped malware will be also auto-cleaned by the real-time malware scanner keeping the system clean and protected.

![](/images/SettingsPHPImmunity.png)

By enabling this feature Blamer will be enabled as well and Proactive Defence switched into the KILL mode.
